# About PE
Project Eclipse is a mod for Halo: CE. This mod will only be available on MCC through the Steam Workshop. This repository will not hold any data from Halo, this only holds custom data and descriptors of levels, weapons, abilities, etc. This concludes the small amount of preamble, below this opening statement is all the information *you* should know about this repository and this mod as a whole.

## Why I'm Making This Mod
The answer to this is a bit long but I'll try not to ramble too much during this answer.

I'm developing this because bluntly put, I love Halo and have for years. Recently I've been playing a lot of MCC (Specifically CE) and have also been messing around with mods. (Mostly Cursed Halo Again) Mods like this and a few other onces which I'll make sure to credit have inspired me to take my love for this game to a new level and make a huge mod project on it! As the sole contributor, I may as well be developing an entire game, sure there is already *a lot* for me to work off of, but the sheer amount of content I plan to add would bog down an entire development team for months, let alone one person. I'll go into detail on what is being added in the next section.

I'm a passionate woman, not in a sensual sense, I have a passion for the games I love. Halo is quite clearly one of them, this project is my love letter to Halo and to [343 Industries](https://www.343industries.com/) for this amazing game series. I am showing my passion as a Halo fan by creating this absolutely massive mod. I should probably consider calling this a whole game once it is finished.

## What's Being Added to PE?

### Missions
On top of the 10 missions the vanilla game offers, I will be massively expanding on the story and world of CE, adding **20 brand new missions** to the game, totalling 30 missions. Vanilla missions will also have some modifications to them, such as minor changes to layouts and obstacles, changes to friendly and hostile AI, weapon tweaks and *far more.* 

### Weapons
I'll be adding a few weapons from Halo 2 into this mod and also some brand new custom weapons. Vanilla weapons will also be tweaked in non-gamebreaking ways. These changes are to make every weapon viable enough that they can be used in the majority of missions without feeling like a crutch or a burden on the player.

### Cutscenes
New cutscenes, plenty of them. After all having a black transition from one mission to another would be quite boring. I'll be making new scenes that follow more of an alternative story to the original CE. Details on this headcanon story will be written in a separete *.md file.

### New NPCs
That's right, brand new characters and enemies, some from the future games, others fresh from the headcanon. These will be in a separate *.md file as well.

### General Game Tweaks
Some small tweaks to add some challenge and have the player conserve their resources closely. The main idea was to use the code from the skulls **Famine, Catch, and Ghost.** To read up on these skulls, refer to the [Halopedia](https://www.halopedia.org/Halo:_The_Master_Chief_Collection_skulls#List_of_skulls) on skulls to learn more or to refresh yourself.

I chose these in specific as they add challenge to the game while keeping it fair. The smaller details from mission to mission will be available in the respective markdown files, please find the one you're looking for and read on your own time. (Sorry if this sounds rude.)
