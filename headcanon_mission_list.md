# Preamble (Please Read!)
**The following document will list all 30 missions in Project Eclipse, the story behind it and the entire headcanon. If you do not want any spoilers on the story, please _do not read further than this preamble!_**

**Missions marked with (V) are Vanilla and are meant to be in the game. While missions with (PE) were made solely for Eclipse.**

## Mission 1: The Pillar of Autumn (V)

The beginning preamble and tutorial nonsense is cut out and you're instead awoken to the two men sent to wake you already dead and your cyro tube, and those around yours damaged and opened for emergency purposes. The observation window above has two high level elites smashing up the computer in an attempt to harm the systems keeping you alive. Once you free yourself from the cryo tube, pick up a pistol from one of the bodies, both pistols only have enough rounds for one magazine, leaving you with only 24 to get to the bridge. 

Upon exiting the Cryo Room, you'll find the original left path totally inaccessable. Follow the only viable path through the stuck doors (They're the same ones from later in the mission, so just use melee on them) and fight your way through waves of Suicide Grunts, Elites, and even a Hunter to get to the Bridge. Naturally, almost everyone is dead or injured. Captain Keyes will direct you to a soldier who hands you a spare SMG (Halo 2) with only three magazines worth of ammunition.
