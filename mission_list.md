# Preamble (Please Read!)
**The following document will list all 30 missions in Project Eclipse, the story behind it and the entire headcanon. If you do not want any spoilers on the story, please _do not read further than this preamble!_**

**Missions marked with (V) are Vanilla and are meant to be in the game. While missions with (PE) were made solely for Eclipse.**

## Mission 1: The Pillar of Autumn (V)

The beginning preamble and tutorial nonsense is cut out and you're instead awoken to the two men sent to wake you already dead and your cyro tube, and those around yours damaged and opened for emergency purposes. The observation window above has two high level elites smashing up the computer in an attempt to harm the systems keeping you alive. Once you free yourself from the cryo tube, pick up a pistol from one of the bodies, both pistols only have enough rounds for one magazine, leaving you with only 24 to get to the bridge. (12 loaded, 12 spare)

Upon exiting the Cryo Room, you'll find the original left path totally inaccessable. Follow the only viable path through the stuck doors (They're the same ones from later in the mission, so just use melee on them) and fight your way through waves of Suicide Grunts, Elites, and even a Hunter to get to the Bridge. Naturally, almost everyone is dead or injured. Captain Keyes will direct you to a soldier who hands you a spare SMG (Halo 2) with only three magazines worth of ammunition. In place of the three grunts outside the bridge entrance, there are three Elites, two Blue Elites and a Red Elite.

Upon entering the lunch area, there are a few Suicide Grunts who will run at NPC soldiers and blow them up, leaving the player access to some well needed SMG ammo and access to the Assault Rifle, which has been slightly modified to only hold 30 bullets rather than 60 but it also has 75% more damage per shot and less bullet spread. The rest of the mission is basically the same, some Grunts are now Suicide Grunts, some became Blue Elites, all Blue Elites from Vanilla are Red, and there is a Hunter mini-boss fight in the second last long hallway to the lifeboat. You also get provided with frag grenades from the bodies of fallen soldiers, these are gonna be quite helpful.

## Mission 2: Loss of Cabin Pressure (PE)

As the escape pod fires from the Autumn and speeding towards Halo, a trio of Banshees operated by Red Elites swarm the pod, opening fire and killing the pilot, destroying the glass in the process. As the pod rapidly depressurizes, it is up to the player to navigate the pod to a safe landing spot and simultaneously avoid being destroyeed by the Banshees. This is a relatively short mission but provides a bit more story and begins the headcanon part of the story well, making the Convenant a much more aggressive group. There is a 5 minute time limit but the mission completes in about 3 minutes 45 seconds, it's there to add tension to the game.

## Mission 3: Halo (V)

Over 80% of *Halo* is not changed in a major way, enemies are replaced but that's standard, the player gains access to the Shotgun right away with only a paltry 5 rounds to their name. The first major change of *Halo* is the Light Bridge, it is already active but is heavily defended by Wraiths and Gold Elites. Bands of lost UNSC soldiers can be found and are key to restoring ammo. Using Covenant weapons is possible but they all have 20% or lower battery to encourage the player to stick to human weapons without forcing them.

The mission ends with the player starting a beacon up to get a Pelican to pick up the player and a small group of UNSC soldiers they came across. Before the Pelican can land, the player must survive 6 waves of Dropships dropping Silver Elites, Jackals (Now carrying dual wielded Plasma Pistols and no more shield, they also have more health.), and more.
